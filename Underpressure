One time I was under pressure was when I had an important task to finish the same evening as a close friend’s birthday party. I really wanted to attend, but the work had a strict deadline. 
I felt the time pressure, so I planned my evening carefully. I broke the task into smaller parts, focused fully, and avoided distractions like my phone. 
Whenever I got stuck, I quickly clarified what I needed instead of wasting time. I finished the task before the deadline and was still able to attend the party, 
even if a bit late. That experience taught me that I can stay calm under pressure, manage my time well, and still deliver quality work.”



“One situation where I was under pressure was when I had to complete an important task with a very tight deadline. 
There were multiple things going on at the same time, and I felt the time crunch. Instead of panicking, I broke the work into smaller steps and focused on finishing one thing at a time. 
I also made sure to remove distractions and, when needed, asked quick clarifying questions to avoid mistakes. In the end, 
I completed the task on time and learned that I actually work well under pressure because it helps me stay focused and prioritize what really matters.”
