One time I was under pressure was when I had an important task to finish the same evening as a close friend’s birthday party. I really wanted to attend, but the work had a strict deadline. 
I felt the time pressure, so I planned my evening carefully. I broke the task into smaller parts, focused fully, and avoided distractions like my phone. 
Whenever I got stuck, I quickly clarified what I needed instead of wasting time. I finished the task before the deadline and was still able to attend the party, 
even if a bit late. That experience taught me that I can stay calm under pressure, manage my time well, and still deliver quality work.”



“One situation where I was under pressure was when I had to complete an important task with a very tight deadline. 
There were multiple things going on at the same time, and I felt the time crunch. Instead of panicking, I broke the work into smaller steps and focused on finishing one thing at a time. 
I also made sure to remove distractions and, when needed, asked quick clarifying questions to avoid mistakes. In the end, 
I completed the task on time and learned that I actually work well under pressure because it helps me stay focused and prioritize what really matters.”





“One mistake I made earlier was trying to handle everything by myself on a team project. I thought asking for help might make me look less capable, 
so I didn’t communicate when I was falling behind. Because of that, the work got delayed and I felt unnecessary stress. I realized that the mistake wasn’t the workload — 
it was my lack of communication. Since then, I’ve learned to speak up earlier, ask for clarification when needed, and keep my team updated on my progress. 
This has helped me work more efficiently and avoid similar issues in the future.”
